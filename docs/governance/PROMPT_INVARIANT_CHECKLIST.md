# PaA Prompt Invariant Checklist

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Author:** Manus AI  
**Status:** 🟢 **Active & Enforced**

> **This document is subordinate to the Master Control Board. It defines the minimum requirements for any PaA execution prompt to be considered valid.**

---

## 1. Purpose

This checklist ensures that every Prompts-as-Artifacts (PaA) execution prompt is complete, unambiguous, and enforceable. It guarantees that all execution is traceable, verifiable, and aligned with the platform's governance model. If a prompt does not satisfy every item on this checklist, it is considered **invalid** and cannot be used to authorize work.

## 3. Governance Statement (Binding)

> “Execution prompts are governed artifacts. If a prompt does not explicitly require GitHub persistence and Control Board synchronization, the execution is invalid by definition.”

This statement is enforced by the Master Control Board and applies to all execution across the WebWaka platform.
