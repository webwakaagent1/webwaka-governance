## 7. Multi-Level Revenue Trees

### 7.1 Revenue Tree Structure

```
Organization
  ├── Affiliate 1 (Tier 1, 10% commission)
  │   ├── Affiliate 1.1 (Tier 2, 8% commission)
  │   │   └── Affiliate 1.1.1 (Tier 3, 6% commission)
  │   └── Affiliate 1.2 (Tier 2, 8% commission)
  └── Affiliate 2 (Tier 1, 10% commission)
      └── Affiliate 2.1 (Tier 2, 8% commission)
```

### 7.2 Commission Distribution

When a sale is attributed to Affiliate 1.1.1:
1. Affiliate 1.1.1 receives 6% commission
2. Affiliate 1.1 receives 2% (tier-based reduction)
3. Affiliate 1 receives 1% (tier-based reduction)

**Tier Reduction Formula:**
```
Commission for Tier N = Base Rate × (1 - 0.1 × (N - 1))

Example:
- Tier 1: 10% × (1 - 0) = 10%
- Tier 2: 10% × (1 - 0.1) = 9%
- Tier 3: 10% × (1 - 0.2) = 8%
```

---

## 8. Revenue Models

### 8.1 Platform-First Model

Platform takes its cut first, remainder distributed to partners/affiliates.

```
Sale Amount: $100
Platform Cut: 30% = $30
Remaining: $70
  ├── Partner Cut: 50% = $35
  └── Affiliate Commission: 50% = $35
```

### 8.2 Partner-Owned Model

Partner owns revenue, pays platform a fee.

```
Sale Amount: $100
Partner Revenue: $100
  ├── Platform Fee: 10% = $10
  └── Partner Net: $90
```

### 8.3 Client-Owned Model

Client owns revenue, pays platform a fee.

```
Sale Amount: $100
Client Revenue: $100
  ├── Platform Fee: 5% = $5
  └── Client Net: $95
```

### 8.4 Zero-Platform-Cut Model

Platform takes no cut.

```
Sale Amount: $100
Platform Cut: 0% = $0
Partner/Affiliate Revenue: $100
```

### 8.5 Hybrid Model

Combination of models based on conditions.

```
If Sale Amount < $50:
  - Platform-First (30% cut)
Else:
  - Partner-Owned (10% fee)
```
