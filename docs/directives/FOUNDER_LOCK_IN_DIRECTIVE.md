# FOUNDER LOCK-IN DIRECTIVE: Agentic Operating Model

**Document Type:** Founder Directive  
**Authority:** Founder  
**Status:** RATIFIED & LOCKED  
**Effective Date:** February 1, 2026  
**Scope:** All Manus agents, all repositories, all future work  

---

## PURPOSE

This directive formally establishes the **Role-Based, GitHub-Anchored Operating Model** for the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory.

It exists to guarantee:
- **Identity-agnostic agent operation** — Any Manus account can assume any role
- **Zero context loss across account switches** — All context lives in GitHub
- **Strong governance, auditability, and continuity** — Founder authority is absolute and low-friction
- **Institutional memory** — Decisions outlive agents

---

## BINDING PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. GitHub Is the Only Source of Truth

- No Manus agent may rely on memory, chat history, or implicit context
- All state, decisions, progress, and outputs must exist in GitHub artifacts
- If it's not in GitHub, it doesn't exist

### 2. Roles Are Instantiated, Not Assigned

- Manus accounts are **interchangeable operators**
- Authority is derived **only from explicit role instantiation prompts**
- No Manus may act outside its declared role
- Roles persist; accounts are disposable

### 3. Context Must Be Explicit and Transferable

- Any work must be resumable by a different Manus account using GitHub alone
- Silent context, implicit assumptions, or undocumented reasoning are **forbidden**
- Context handoffs are mandatory when work is paused or reassigned

### 4. Founder Is the Sole Human Decision Authority

- Agents may recommend, review, or escalate
- **Final approval, overrides, and strategic decisions rest with the Founder only**
- Founder decisions are explicit, logged, and immutable

### 5. No Silent Failure or Abandonment

- Any disengagement must be explicitly documented
- Silence is treated as failure
- Inactivity triggers escalation

---

## MANDATORY OPERATING MECHANISM

All Manus activity **MUST** use the following standardized artifacts:

1. **Role Instantiation Prompt** — Declares role, authority, and constraints
2. **Task Execution Prompt** — Binds work to GitHub context
3. **Lead Review Prompt** — Used when acting as Lead Agent
4. **Context Handoff Summary** — Preserves context on account switch
5. **Stop-Work Declaration** — Prevents silent abandonment

**Failure to comply invalidates the work.**

---

## ENFORCEMENT

- **Governance Agent** enforces compliance
- **Non-compliant work is rejected** regardless of technical quality
- **This directive supersedes all informal practices**
- **CI automation enforces structural compliance**

---

## GOLDEN RULES (MEMORIZE THESE)

1. **If it's not in GitHub, it doesn't exist**
2. **Roles define authority, not accounts**
3. **Context must survive agent death**
4. **Founder decides — agents advise**
5. **Silence is failure**

---

## WHAT THIS GIVES YOU

✅ Unlimited Manus account switching  
✅ Zero context loss  
✅ Perfect auditability  
✅ Institutional memory  
✅ Scalable parallel execution  
✅ Founder control without micromanagement  

---

## EFFECTIVE DATE

This directive takes effect **immediately** and is **immutable** unless explicitly amended by the Founder.
