# FD-2026-001 — Ratification of the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory Governance System

**Status:** RATIFIED  
**Decision Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Effective Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Decision Type:** GOVERNANCE  
**Authority:** Founder  
**Supersedes:** None  
**Impacts:** All repositories, all agents, all future work  

---

## Decision Summary

I hereby ratify the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory as the sole operating model for all present and future WebWaka development. This decision formalizes GitHub as the single source of truth, the Founder as the sole human decision authority, and agents as execution, verification, and recommendation entities only. All governance artifacts are binding and enforceable.

---

## Context

The WebWaka platform requires a scalable, auditable operating model that enables multiple Manus agents to work in parallel without context loss, memory dependencies, or authority ambiguity. Previous informal approaches created risks of silent abandonment, decision drift, and context loss on account switching.

**Related artifacts:**
- Founder Lock-In Directive
- Agentic Operating Model
- Role Instantiation Prompt Pack
- GitHub Organization Transition Completion Report

## Options Considered

### Option A: Informal Coordination
**Description:** Continue with ad-hoc coordination, relying on chat memory and implicit context.

**Pros:**
- Minimal setup overhead
- Flexible and organic

**Cons:**
- Context loss on account switching
- Silent abandonment risk
- No auditability
- Founder authority unclear
- Unscalable to multiple agents

### Option B: Formal Agentic Operating Model (SELECTED)
**Description:** Implement role-based, GitHub-anchored operating model with explicit governance artifacts, mandatory templates, and CI enforcement.

**Pros:**
- Zero context loss
- Account-agnostic agent operation
- Perfect auditability
- Founder authority is absolute but low-effort
- Scales to unlimited agents
- Institutional memory
- Enforceable governance

**Cons:**
- Initial setup effort
- Requires discipline in documentation
- CI automation required

### Option C: Hybrid (Partial Governance)
**Description:** Implement governance only for critical decisions, keep execution informal.

**Pros:**
- Lower initial overhead

**Cons:**
- Incomplete coverage
- Still vulnerable to context loss
- Inconsistent enforcement
- Ambiguous authority boundaries

## Decision

The Founder has decided to:

> **Adopt and ratify Option B: Formal Agentic Operating Model as the sole operating framework for the WebWaka Agentic Software Factory.**

This decision is:
- ☐ Reversible
- ☑ Irreversible without explicit new Founder decision

---

## Rationale

Option B is selected because:

1. **Scalability** — The WebWaka factory requires parallel execution by multiple Manus agents. Option B is the only model that enables this without context loss or authority ambiguity.

2. **Auditability** — All work must be traceable to explicit decisions and governance rules. Option B creates a complete audit trail in GitHub.

3. **Founder Control** — The Founder retains absolute authority while minimizing micromanagement burden. Decisions are explicit and enforceable.

4. **Institutional Memory** — Context persists in GitHub, not in Manus chat memory. This enables account switching, agent replacement, and long-term continuity.

5. **Risk Mitigation** — Option B eliminates silent abandonment, decision drift, and context loss—the primary risks of informal coordination.

## Scope & Impact

**Affected Repositories:**
- All 12 WebWaka repositories
- All future repositories

**Affected Systems:**
- All development workflows
- All planning and execution
- All testing and verification
- All deployment

**Affected Agents/Roles:**
- Chief of Staff
- Execution Coordinator
- Quality Assurance & Verification Agent
- Security & Risk Assessment Agent
- Documentation & Knowledge Management Agent
- All future roles

**Affected Invariants:**
- INV-001: GitHub is the canonical system of record
- INV-010: Offline-first is non-negotiable
- INV-012: Multi-repository topology is authoritative
- INV-013: Test-first development is mandatory
- INV-014: Founder decisions are explicit, logged, and immutable

---

## Enforcement Instructions

**What agents MUST do:**
1. Instantiate using the Role Instantiation Prompt Pack at the start of every session
2. Ground all context in GitHub artifacts only
3. Declare acting role, team, and authority level in every issue and PR
4. Reference relevant Founder Decisions (FD-YYYY-NNN) in all work
5. Use mandatory GitHub templates for issues and PRs
6. Provide Context Handoff Summaries when pausing or switching work
7. Escalate ambiguity, conflicts, and decisions to the Founder immediately
8. Document all decisions and rationale in GitHub

**What agents MUST NOT do:**
1. Rely on chat memory or implicit context
2. Assume authority outside declared role
3. Make decisions without Founder approval
4. Override or ignore governance rules
5. Proceed with work when required context is missing
6. Silently abandon work without documentation
7. Approve their own work
8. Assume scope beyond what is explicitly documented

---

## Mandatory Artifacts

This decision requires the following artifacts to be implemented:

1. **Founder Lock-In Directive** — Binding principles and mandatory mechanisms
2. **Agentic Operating Model** — Detailed doctrine and procedures
3. **Role Instantiation Prompt Pack** — Canonical prompts for all roles
4. **Context Handoff Standard** — Mandatory handoff procedures
5. **GitHub Templates** — Task, Founder Decision Request, PR templates
6. **GitHub Workflows** — Governance enforcement automation
7. **Founder Decision Log System** — Decision tracking and enforcement
8. **Invariant Enforcement** — CI checks for invariant compliance

---

## Supersession Rules

This decision may only be changed by:
- A new Founder Decision (FD-YYYY-NNN)
- Explicit reference to FD-2026-001
- No silent overrides or implicit changes

Any future decision that contradicts this must explicitly reference FD-2026-001 and explain the change.

## Effective Date

This decision takes effect **immediately** and retroactively governs all ongoing work.

All agents must comply with this operating model from this date forward.
