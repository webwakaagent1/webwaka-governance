# Control Board Amendment: Addition of CB-4

**Date:** January 30, 2026
**Amendment Type:** Governance Correction
**Author:** Manus AI
**Status:** Proposed / Pending Ratification

---

## 1. Subject of Amendment

This amendment proposes the formal addition of Phase **CB-4 (Inventory Management Capability)** to the WebWaka Master Control Board.

---

## 2. Justification

A comprehensive review of all canonical documentation has confirmed that CB-4 is a **missing capability phase**, not an error or obsolete reference.

*   **Consistent Reference:** CB-4 is consistently referenced as "Inventory Management Capability" in the Master Implementation Plan, architecture documents, and suite definitions (SC-1 and SC-3).
*   **Explicit Definition:** The Master Implementation Plan explicitly defines CB-4's objective: "Build a channel-agnostic inventory management capability that serves as the single source of truth for inventory. Sales channels will subscribe to this capability."
*   **Governance Gap:** The Master Control Board is the only canonical document that does not contain a definition for CB-4.

This amendment corrects this governance gap, aligns the Master Control Board with all other canonical documents, and unblocks suite construction planning.

## 3. Proposed Definition for CB-4

The following definition shall be added to the "Capability Build-Out Phases" section of the Master Control Board:
