# Wave 3 Planning Report

**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Purpose:** Synthesize all Wave 3 planning analysis into a single, decision-grade report for Founder ratification.

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**Platform State:** The WebWaka platform is in a strong position after the successful completion of all seven Wave 1 and Wave 2 phases. The foundation and core services are robust, and the platform is ready to advance on multiple fronts.

**Wave 3 Recommendation:** I recommend the **full parallel execution of all four eligible Wave 3 candidate phases:**

1.  **PF-3:** AI & High-Complexity Readiness
2.  **CB-1:** MLAS Capability
3.  **ID-1:** Enterprise Deployment Automation
4.  **ID-3:** Global Expansion & Multi-Region

**Platform Assignment:** **Manus** is the recommended platform for all four phases due to their high-stakes, governance-sensitive, and security-critical nature.

**Critical Blocker:** All suite construction phases (SC-1, SC-2, SC-3) are blocked pending the definition of **CB-4** and the completion of **CB-1** and **PF-3**.

## 2. Founder Decisions Required

To proceed with Wave 3, the Founder must ratify the following:

1.  **Wave 3 Authorization:** Do you approve the parallel execution of PF-3, CB-1, ID-1, and ID-3 as Wave 3?
2.  **Platform Assignment:** Do you approve the assignment of all four Wave 3 phases to Manus?
3.  **Prompt Creation:** Do you authorize the creation of v2 PaA execution prompts for all four Wave 3 phases?
4.  **CB-4 Governance Gap:** What is the definition and scope of CB-4? Is it a typo, a missing phase, or something else?

## 3. Supporting Analysis

This report is supported by the following detailed analysis documents:

*   **Wave 3 Candidate Phase Identification:** Identifies the four eligible and four ineligible phases.

4.  **Execution Dispatch:** I provide you with the execution links for dispatch to the assigned Manus accounts.
5.  **Wave 3 Execution:** The four phases are executed in parallel.
6.  **Verification:** I verify the completion of all four phases.
