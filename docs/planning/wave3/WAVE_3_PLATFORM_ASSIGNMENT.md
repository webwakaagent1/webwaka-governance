# Wave 3 Platform Assignment Recommendation

**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Purpose:** Recommend the optimal execution platform for each of the four Wave 3 candidate phases based on risk profile, complexity, and governance sensitivity.

## 1. Platform Suitability Analysis

| Platform | Strengths | Ideal For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Manus** | Governance-sensitive, security-critical, complex logic, high-stakes infrastructure | PF-3, CB-1, ID-1, ID-3 |
| **Replit** | Implementation-heavy, iterative backend work, well-defined APIs, lower-risk capabilities | N/A for Wave 3 |

---

## 2. Recommended Platform Assignments

| Phase ID | Phase Name | Recommended Platform | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PF-3** | AI & High-Complexity Readiness | **Manus** | High-stakes infrastructure, complex logic, security-critical (BYOK), governance-sensitive (billing, model selection) |
| **CB-1** | MLAS Capability | **Manus** | High-stakes business logic, security-critical (revenue sharing), governance-sensitive (multi-level attribution) |
| **ID-1** | Enterprise Deployment Automation | **Manus** | High-stakes infrastructure, security-critical (deployment pipeline), governance-sensitive (versioning, rollbacks) |
| **ID-3** | Global Expansion & Multi-Region | **Manus** | High-stakes infrastructure, security-critical (data residency), governance-sensitive (cross-border access) |

## 3. Rationale

**All four Wave 3 candidate phases are high-stakes, governance-sensitive, and security-critical.** They involve foundational infrastructure, core business logic, and enterprise-grade deployment capabilities.

*   **PF-3 (AI & High-Complexity Readiness)** involves complex AI orchestration, BYOK security, and flexible billing models, making it a perfect fit for Manus's strengths in complex, governance-sensitive work.
*   **CB-1 (MLAS Capability)** is the core revenue-sharing engine of the platform. Its implementation must be flawless, auditable, and secure, making it a clear choice for Manus.
*   **ID-1 (Enterprise Deployment Automation)** and **ID-3 (Global Expansion & Multi-Region)** are both high-stakes infrastructure projects that require a deep understanding of security, governance, and long-term scalability. Manus is the ideal platform for this type of work.

**Replit is not recommended for any Wave 3 phases.** While Replit is excellent for implementation-heavy backend work, the four candidate phases are all too critical and governance-sensitive to be delegated to a platform with less emphasis on security and governance.

## 4. Summary

*   **Manus is the recommended platform for all four Wave 3 candidate phases.**
*   **The high-stakes nature of these phases makes them a poor fit for Replit.**

**Next Step:** Propose the required Master Control Board updates to authorize Wave 3 execution.
