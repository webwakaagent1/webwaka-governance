## 3. Governance Gap Annotation

**Add the following note to the top of the Master Control Board, below the Wave 2 completion notice:**

```
> **Governance Gap Identified:** Phase **CB-4** is referenced as a dependency for SC-1 and SC-3 but is not defined. Suite construction is blocked until this is resolved by the Founder.
```

## 4. Summary

These updates will:

*   Clearly authorize the four Wave 3 phases for parallel execution.
*   Assign Manus as the execution platform for all four phases.
*   Make the CB-4 governance gap visible at the highest level of the platform.

**Next Step:** Synthesize all findings into a final Wave 3 Planning Report.
