**Author:** Manus AI  
**Status:** 🟡 **Authorized for Execution**

> **This document is subordinate to the Master Control Board.**

## 1. Core Objective

To implement the foundational platform extensions required to support stateful compute, instance orchestration, and the Super Admin control plane. This phase establishes the infrastructure primitives that enable all future capabilities, including the "Compile & Deploy" automation, multi-instance management, and advanced service orchestration.

## 2. Canonical Governance Reference

*   **Master Control Board:** [§7.2 PF-1: Foundational Extensions](../governance/WEBWAKA_MASTER_CONTROL_BOARD.md#pf-1-foundational-extensions)
*   **Dependencies:** Phase 2B (IAM & Tenant Isolation Hardening) - Complete

---

## 3. Key Features & Scope

This phase will deliver the following foundational capabilities:

| Feature | Description | Key Attributes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stateful Compute** | Infrastructure for long-running, stateful background jobs and scheduled tasks. | Supports async workflows, job queues, and retry logic. |
| **Instance Orchestration** | Ability to provision, configure, and manage multiple isolated platform instances. | Enables the "Compile & Deploy" model for self-hosted clients. |
| **Super Admin Control Plane** | A dedicated control plane for Super Admin operations, including platform configuration, partner lifecycle management, and tenant lifecycle control. | Audited, secure, and explicitly separated from tenant operations. |
| **Version & Upgrade Control** | Infrastructure to manage platform versions, suite versions, and update channel policies (auto-update, manual-approval, frozen). | Supports version pinning and rollback. |

---

## 4. Architectural Principles & Alignment

This phase must adhere to all 10 platform invariants, with particular emphasis on:

| Invariant | Implementation in PF-1 |
| :--- | :--- |
| **INV-002: Strict Tenant Isolation** | The Super Admin control plane is architecturally separated from tenant operations. |
| **INV-003: Audited Super Admin Access** | All Super Admin actions are logged and auditable. |
| **INV-004: Layered Dependency Rule** | This phase provides foundation-layer primitives. No higher-layer dependencies are allowed. |
| **INV-008: Update Policy as Governed Lifecycle** | The infrastructure supports all update channel policies and version pinning. |

## 🚀 EXECUTION PROMPT: Implement Foundational Extensions (PF-1)

**Objective:** Implement the foundational platform extensions required to support stateful compute, instance orchestration, and the Super Admin control plane.

**Scope:**
- Stateful compute infrastructure (job queue, scheduler, worker orchestration)
- Instance orchestration service for multi-instance management
- Super Admin control plane API
- Version and upgrade control service with update channel policy enforcement
- Auditing and logging infrastructure for Super Admin actions

**Non-Goals:**
- User-facing features (those belong in suites)
- Specific suite implementations (those come in later phases)
- Realtime infrastructure (that is PF-2)
- AI infrastructure (that is PF-3)

**Canonical Governance:**
- **Master Control Board:** [§7.2 PF-1: Foundational Extensions](../governance/WEBWAKA_MASTER_CONTROL_BOARD.md#pf-1-foundational-extensions)
- **Dependencies:** Phase 2B (Complete)
- **Platform Invariants:** INV-002, INV-003, INV-004, INV-008

**Deliverables:**
1. Stateful compute infrastructure deployed and operational
2. Instance orchestration service with API
3. Super Admin control plane with full CRUD operations for platform configuration, partner management, and tenant management
4. Version and upgrade control service supporting auto-update, manual-approval, and frozen update channels
5. Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests)

**Required Documentation Outputs:**
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for all major implementation choices
- API documentation for the Super Admin control plane
- Operational runbooks for instance provisioning, upgrade management, and rollback procedures

**Output:** All technical architecture and implementation details must be documented in a new `ARCH_PF1_FOUNDATIONAL_EXTENSIONS.md` file within the `/docs/architecture` directory. Link this new document back to this section upon completion.
